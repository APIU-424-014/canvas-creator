isValid: fixed
PathCollector checks whether arguments are complete prior to adding to path.

2015.02.06
Moved to use the prototype object for classes
Added some comments
HtmlEvents are now bound a bit different. An anonymous method is used to call the redirector method. To keep the this-context pointing to the html element in the redirector the redirectors "function.call" method is used.

2015.02.05
Event: arguments are passed as arguments beginning with 'sender' (used to be sender and a list of arguments)
Path: capable to add modes and valueLists, emits changedEvent on add
Drawer: draws objects which provide a draw(context)-method within a given rectangle, draw method matches paths changedEvent
Coder: sets the innerHTML of [HTML Object] to the code returned by objects providing toCode(nameOfContext) methods, show method matches paths changedEvent
